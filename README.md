# Decentalized-To-Do-List
Implemented a Decentralized To-Do List using Ethereum Smart Contracts using Truffle Framework . The user can create a list of tasks according to their priority and check them off once done. The web app provides a user-friendly web app UI for the to-do list.
The Metamask Wallet is required to process the transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. The app helps the user to be organized and also acts as a memory aid.
